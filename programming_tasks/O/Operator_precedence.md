# [Operator precedence][1]

See [this table](http://perlcabal.org/syn/S03.html#Operator_precedence) for a list of the precedence levels. PerlÂ 6 is an operator-rich language (and users may define more operators at will), so instead of listing all the operators in the table, representative operators are listed for some of the precedence levels; see later in the same file for a more complete list of predefined operators at each precedence level.
