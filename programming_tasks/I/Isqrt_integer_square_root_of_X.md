# [Isqrt (integer square root) of X][1]

Since there is already the task [Integer roots](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Integer_roots) that covers *exactly* this operation, with the caveat that it will calculate **any** nth root (including 2) not just **square** roots, we'll refer you to that.



See the [Integer roots](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Integer_roots#Raku) Raku entry.
