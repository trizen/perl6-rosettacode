```raku
say $_ for @collection;
```


Perl 6 leaves off the `each` from `foreach`, leaving us with `for` instead. The variable `$_` refers to the current element, unless you assign a name to it using `->`.

```raku
for @collection -> $currentElement { say $currentElement; }
```


Perl 6 will do it's best to put the topic at the right spot.

```raku
.say for @collection;
for @collection { .say };
```


Iteration can also be done with hyperoperators. In this case it's a candidate for autothreading and as such, execution order may vary. The resulting list will be in order.

```text
@collection>>.say;
@collection>>.=&infix:<+>(2); # increment each element by 2
```
